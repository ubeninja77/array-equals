# Array Equals
Determines if the two input integer arrays are equal. The two arrays will be considered equal if they both have the exact same count of elements in the exact same order.

## Exercise
* <strong>Author a method</strong> named `array_equals` that accepts two integer arrays as input parameters. The method should return `true` if the arrays contain the same count of elements, the element values in the array are the same and they are in the same exact order. Otherwise, the method should return `false`.

**Note:** Do not use Array class methods for comparing the whole array at once. You may use array indexing to retrieve one element at a time, you may compare individual elements with each other and you may retrieve the length of an array. Do not use any other Ruby provided functions.
